Smart contracts tutorials and info, with a view to making them secure and robust. WIP...


Solidity Smart Contracts
========================

  IDE's
  =====
   1. Remix (great intro to smart contracts & testing) https://remix.ethereum.org
   2. WebStorm
   3. Visual Code
    
  Unit Testing Frameworks (Functional)
  ==================
   1. Truffle
   2. Hardhat
   3. Foundry
   4. OpenZepplin
    
  Security Based Testing
  ======================
   Static Testing Tools
    
   Static testing is the process of testing smart contracts via code inspection, looking for weaknesses in code potentially leading to exploits.
     1. rand tool
    
   Dynamic Testing Tools
    
   Dynamic testing is the process of testing smart contracts on (ideally) test networks by fuzzing contracts, passing out of bounds arguments etc.
