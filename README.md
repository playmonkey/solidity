# Audting Solidity Contracts
Smart contracts tutorials and info for learning essential auditing skills. 


Roadmap to Audit Solidity Smart Contracts
=========================================

NB: This roadmap is largely based on the roadmap by @0kage_eth. Massive thanks for the roadmap! You can find it here: https://twitter.com/0kage_eth/status/1640795987152375808 (I believe by typing/writing it down will help in understanding/retaining core knowledge)

Estimated time to build necessary skills is around 12-26weeks depending on your experience levels in each of the topics and time available.

1. Understand EVM 
2. Learn Solidity Concepts
3. Learn Foundry
4. Interact with Web3 protocols
5. Master writing test cases
6. Understand Security issues and read reports
7. Practice CTF's



  IDE's
  =====
   1. Remix (great intro to smart contracts & testing) https://remix.ethereum.org
   2. WebStorm (If you are a student, all the IDE's are free for non-commerical use)
   3. Visual Code
    
  Unit Testing/Deployment/Management Frameworks (Functional)
  ==================
   1. Truffle
   2. Hardhat
   3. Foundry
   4. OpenZepplin
    
  Security Based Testing
  ======================
   Static Testing Tools
    
   Static testing is the process of testing smart contracts via code inspection, looking for weaknesses in code potentially leading to exploits.
     1. rand tool
    
   Dynamic Testing Tools
    
   Dynamic testing is the process of testing smart contracts on (ideally) test networks by fuzzing contracts, passing out of bounds arguments etc. 
     1. rand tool 1
